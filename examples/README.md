## Usage examples and string matching problems

These examples use as input data files that sit under the [data
directory](../data).

You can run each example by executing its command. For instance:

    $ ant run-trie-example

Here's the complete list of available examples.

* Using TrieST implementation:
  * `ant run-trie-example`
  * `ant run-dictionary-example`
* Using SuffixArray implementation:
  * `ant run-suffixArray-example`
  * `ant run-lrs-example`
  * `ant run-lcs-example`
  * `ant run-kwik-example`

*Note: a better approach for running the examples is yet to be determined.*
